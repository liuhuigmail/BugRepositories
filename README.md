# Bug Repositories

With the support of NSFC, we have established a collection of bug repositories aimed at facilitating research related to software bugs. These repositories serve various purposes such as software testing, fault localization, and program repair. Notably, certain unique types of bugs, such as resource leakage defects and concurrency defects, present distinct challenges in terms of their detection, analysis, and reproduction. To address this, we have developed a comprehensive bug repository named "GrowingBugs," which encompasses common bugs, as well as several specialized bug repositories dedicated to specific types of bugs, such as resource leakage defects.

## GrowingBugs

This is a bug repository that keeps growing, called growingBugs. Notably, each bug in growingBugs is composed of a buggy version, a fixed version, a concise patch (bug-fixing changes only), and one or more triggering test cases. To date, growingBugs contains 1911 real-world bugs from open-source Java projects. 

GrowingBugs is publically available at https://github.com/liuhuigmail/GrowingBugRepository
